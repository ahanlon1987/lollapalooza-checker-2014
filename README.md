##Lollapalooza Checker 2014

This is a lightweight node.js application to check the DOM of Lollapalooza.com and Lollapalooza.com/tickets for possible changes that may indicate tickets are on sale.  It also uses Twilio's Node.js Library to send a text message once the app detects tickets are on sale.  In no way is it perfect.  This was built for fun.

##Note:  If you submit a pull request and it is merged, email me your number.  I will gladly add your number to the numbers twilio sends the text message to, to thank you for your help!
